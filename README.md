#NIKE-Webapp

##Description
-> Our Webapp is an review-based applicaion.
-> The user will be able to post reviews about NIKE's products and view other reviews. 
-> Users will also be able to click on the products and will be forwarded to the offical NIKE-store website.
-> The user will be able to filter by certain products(e.g. Filter: Shoes or Filter: T-Shirts) and the products with the best reviews will be ranked at the top, like a    leaderboard.
-> Rating will be based on star stars, so from at least 1 star - 5 stars(worst to best).
-> To comment you will have to login first.
-> We'll try to include other ratings, like facebook comments, to the comment section, so people see what rating the product has, even if no one wrote a comment on our       website. 
-> There will be an average rating shown on the top of the rating section at every product and the numbers of the total reviews of that product(e.g. Rated by 134 users).
